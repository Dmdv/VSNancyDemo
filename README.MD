# NancyFX 2.0 barneyrubble 
## Running on ASP.NET Core (Kestrel)

Initial repo is barebones with _Home_ Module and _Products_ Module that returns some static lists etc loaded from app.
* Modules are to Nancy as Controllers are to ASP.NET
* Currently we have not even implemented a view engine, so for ex. Products API can only be reached from PostMan (even GET request)

Ready to load and run in Visual Studio with .sln file

Credits to http://talkingdotnet.com's blog post @ http://www.talkingdotnet.com/use-nancyfx-in-asp-net-core/ for help in getting set up.

Plans to use this alongside some other ASP.NET WebAPI's and perhaps use for some profiling versus.
